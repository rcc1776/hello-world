# hello-world

Rob here. I am a metrics-driven product manager and analyst with seven years of experience in SaaS Startups. I have worked with development, marketing, and sales teams to go from no revenue to almost break even. As a founder of a company and one of the first employees at another startup, I know how to understand objectives, set a strategy and execute.
